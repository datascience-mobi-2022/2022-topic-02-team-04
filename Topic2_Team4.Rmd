# Introduction
## Hallmarks of cancer and prostate adenocarcinoma
In 2000, Hanahan and Weinberg defined the characteristics of cancer cells in their publication “The hallmarks of cancer” [@RN20]. They described qualities such as immortalization, immune evasion, or angiogenesis that need to apply to cells to be considered a cancer cell. Additional characteristics were postulated in 2011 [@RN19]. One major hallmark that offers a myriad of pharmacological interventions is the “deregulation of cellular energetics”. Altering metabolic pathways, therefore providing an energy supply, thus supporting cell proliferation, can be seen in various cancer types such as prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) [@RN23].

According to estimates from the International Agency for Research on cancer, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer found in men worldwide - making up about 1.4 million cases of the 10.1 million new cases of all combined cancers diagnosed in males. While the prevalence of prostate cancer is clear, the cause of it is not. However, it has been noticed that prostate cancer can be found more commonly in older males [@RN25]. 
The most recurrent diagnosed prostate cancer type is PRAD [@RN24]. Common and effective ways to treat non-metastatic prostate cancers pose surgery and radiation therapy. Metastatic prostate cancer calls for androgen deprivation therapy [@RN18]. The absence of androgen hormones leads to a significant decrease in the progression of prostate adenocarcinoma but can sometimes be bypassed by the tumor hindering therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the metabolic changes in PRAD [@RN23]. 
 
## Analysis - an overview
The data analysis project revolves around RNA-seq data derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas. It gives an overview of the sample’s transcriptomes. RNA-seq data quantifies the transcripts DNA regions and therefore describes a good way to determine their relevance in specific samples, becaue the amount of reads of an RNA transcript determines the generation of certain proteins (Finotello and Di Camillo, 2014).
Usually, RNA-seq data comprises copious amounts of genes, which is why analyzing single genes has been a common practice (Subramanian et al., 2005). One major challenge is to understand the impact certain expressional changes of a specific gene can have on a whole pathway. To avoid this analyzing RNA-seq data as gene sets instead of single genes is more practical and used in methods such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) or Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) [@RN16; @RN12].
By analyzing the given RNA-seq data the goal was to identify patterns between various cancer types and differences between normal and cancer samples. Additionally, quantifying and clustering pathway activity was to be achieved. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) and heatmaps were the building blocks of dimensional reduction and cluster finding (Lever et al., 2017; McInnes and Healy, 2018). 
To be able to identify gene expression patterns that apply to specific cancer types or a specific phenotype determining a score for every single pathway of each patient is crucial. GSEA and GSVA were tested for this. The former uses the two conditions cancer and normal cell samples to determine an enrichment score (ES). The ES describes whether a predefined list of genes is represented at the top or bottom of the ranked list of genes characterizing gene expression (Subramanian et al., 2005).  
GSVA summarizes single genes into defined pathways or gene sets. This reduces dimensionality of RNA-seq data and eases biological interpretability. Input for the GSVA algorithm RNA-seq data and a list of gene sets. To calculate a ranking score a cumulative density function is estimated for each gene over all samples.  The ranking score is the probability of the specific gene expression in the corresponding sample. These scores are then used to create a ranked list of genes for each sample being basis to access the GSVA ES. Two random walks are done. For the first one, the algorithm iterates over each gene in the ranked list and checks if it is in the gene set. The ranks of only the genes present in the gene set are added to a running sum. In the second random walk, the value one is added to the running sum if the genes are not present in the gene set. The ES is the difference between the largest positive and negative deviations. [@RN16].

# Methods
## Initial raw data
During the project four given data sets were used. The first was an R-object consisting of a list of gene sets for cancer hallmarks. Second, a pan-cancer RNA-seq gene expression data frame for 9,741 patients of 33 various cancer types based on data generated by the “The Cancer Genome Atlas” Research Network: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga. In addition, there was an R-object containing 37 clinical annotations regarding the RNA-seq patients. And fourth, for a focused analysis of PRAD, an R-object with RNA-seq gene expression data of matched tumor tissue and normal tissue of 52 PRAD patients was used.
To get a broader view of the cancer hallmarks and metabolic activities, additional gene sets were chosen from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [@RN10; @RN12] after literature review. Trying to get a large overlap with the genes from the RNA-seq, 509 additional gene sets were used, resulting in a total number of 555 gene sets used during the study. These include 50 hallmark gene sets [@RN10], 186 curated gene sets from the KEGG pathway database [@RN5; @RN6 ;@RN7], 189 oncogenic signature gene sets [@RN10; @RN12]  and the 84 largest ontology gene sets [@RN2; @RN4; @RN8]  as of June 2022.

## Preprocessing and analysis of gene sets
The RNA-seq data came in a log2(TPM) format which served as a normalization technique. The original pan-cancer data frame, which contained 60,498 genes, was preprocessed according to figure 1. What must be pointed out, are the the most interesting biotypes, that were identified via the `EnsDb.Hsapiens.v79` package within the RNA-seq data frame that were kept. These included short non-coding RNAs like small nuclear RNAs, micro RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and small nucleolar RNAs, which are known to have important functions in molecular biology [@RN1]. Furthermore, long non-coding RNAs, which are longer than 200 bp in length and might possess regulatory functions [@RN1; @RN3] and protein-coding genes, were retained. All chosen biotypes also appeared within the pathways. After removing the other biotypes the pan-cancer data frame contained 20,675 genes. Similarly, the combined PRAD data frame was variance filtered using a 60 % quantile threshold. In contrast to the pan-cancer analysis biotypes, only protein-coding genes and long non-coding genes were present resulting in a final data frame with 7,801 genes.

![Preprocessing of RNA-seq data.](report_figures/figure10.jpg)

To check the overlap of the used gene sets with the genes of the RNA-seq Venn diagrams were created. Furthermore, a comparison of the gene sets was performed. All genes were referred to with their Ensemble gene IDs and combined into one list. To take a closer look at the gene sets, the similarity between them was investigated. As a metric which compares how many genes are shared between the different gene sets, the Jaccard Indices
$$
J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|} 
$$
were computed for each combination and visualized and clustered in a heatmap. The Jaccard indices result in a value between zero and one, which is the ratio between the intersection and union of the two respective pathways [@RN9]. 

## Pan-cancer analysis

To start off, different descriptive plots were produced based on the given data, for example checking normality, the distribution of age at diagnosis or cancer types.  For further dimension reduction, a PCA [@RN15] was applied over the full pan-cancer data using the Seurat package. With the resulting first 50 principal components (PCs), a UMAP [@RN14] with a set seed (123) was performed with the uwot package. By using the cosine metric two UMAP components were calculated and later plotted in a two-dimensional plot. The same analysis was used after dividing the whole data into the 33 different cancer types with 35 PCs. 
Next, a GSVA was carried out.For this study, this method resulted in a pathway activity matrix with the samples as columns and 552 pathways as rows. Three pathways were discarded by the GSVA package because of a too small intersection between pathway genes and RNA-seq genes, since the minimum size of the resulting gene sets was set to 3. Otherwise, the function's default settings were used. Trying to determine the win or loss of information caused by the GSVA a PCA followed by UMAP was done for the pathway activity matrix with the same settings as mentioned before. To explain the resulting clusters, the pathway activity for the pathways with the highest variance was visualized in a heatmap. Another heatmap was created in which the mean pathway's activity for each cancer type was determined and plotted against the pathways.
Finally, two linear regression model were built using the BRCA pathway activities. The BRCA patients were split into a training set (70 %) and a validation set (30 %). To predict the “proteasome” pathway two different approaches were used. First, the pathways “Immune_DN”, “mismatch_repair”, and “glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi anchor biosynthesis” were used as predictors. Second, 300 PCs were used. 

## Focused analysis: Prostate adenocarcinoma 
For the focused analysis, the normality was also checked using violin plots and qq-plots. As with the pan-cancer RNA-seq data frame, PCA and UMAP were applied on a combined data frame of tumor and normal samples from RNA-seq. To get a first impression of the differences between the samples, volcano plots were created. Volcano plots are one way to visualize the difference between two conditions and identify genes or pathways that are differentially expressed and whose change in expression is statistically significant. To get a symmetrical distribution around zero the log2 fold change between tumor and normal tissues is calculated for each gene or pathway.
$$
Fold change =  log_2\frac{mean\:tumor}{mean\:normal}
$$
The log2 fold change is plotted on the x-axis. Genes with a log2 fold change higher than +/- 1 were defined to be differentially expressed and pathways with a log2 fold change of +/- 0.4 were defined to be differentially expressed.
Additionally, a paired, nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was performed. This statistical test compares two paired groups that do not need to be normally distributed. The computed p-value was adjusted due to multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction. Before the test an alpha of 0.05 was defined. To get a higher score for the significant tests the -log10 p-value was plotted on the y-axis.

To get a better understanding of the RNA-seq gene’s functions, a gene ontology enrichment analysis (GOEA) was performed. Based on the volcano plot with the genes the 500 differentially expressed genes (UP/DOWN) with the smallest p values (highest significance) were extracted. For these 500 genes the gene ontology (GO) terms were identified using the packages biomaRt and GO.db. (Figure XA, 0.999 quantile). It is important to know that one gene can have multiple GO terms. For every GO term a list with the corresponding genes was created but GO terms with less than 10 corresponding genes were discarded. Finally, the enrichment analysis was performed using the GSVA package with the combined tumor and normal RNA-seq data of focused analysis and the GO term gene lists as gene set list input. All other parameters were equal to the pan-cancer GSVA. On the resulting GO activity matrix were then again PCA and UMAP applied with the same settings as before (Figure XB, UMAP). 

Since GO terms alone do not give information about further interactions or pathways, in the next step the use of the GSEA and GSVA were investigated. Unlike the GSVA the GSEA uses the distinction between two different phenotypes to determine a ranking score for each gene of each patient [@RN28; @RN12]. The log2 fold change can be used to determine this score to enable the ranking of the genes of each patient. Since approximately 28% of the log2 fold change showed to have ties the fGSEA couldn’t be applied here. When applying the GSVA, 20 gene sets were discarded by the function. After GSVA, a new volcano plot was created and PCA and UMAP were applied on the pathway activity matrix. Furthermore, the pathway activity of six selected upregulated genes from a pathway volcano plot was visualized. The shown pathways are pathways that did not already appear in the pan-cancer plots. When calculating the pathway activity with the GSVA an error occurs because larger gene sets automatically get a higher enrichment score. One opportunity to correct this error would be to count how many genes of the gene set are included in the TCGA data frame and determine how many differentially expressed genes are in the gene set.

# Results

## Preprocessing and analysis of gene sets
To reduce the dimensionality variance and biotype filtering were performed, resulting in a data frame with only a third of the starting number of genes. The remaining genes were visualized in a mean-variance plot (Figure 2A) showing a smaller number of genes with a very large variance compared to the rest. Before reducing the RNA-seq data into pathways, the overlap between the RNA-seq genes and the used gene was investigated. In pan-cancer analysis, 12,248 RNA-seq genes (59 %) were included in the gene sets (Figure 2B). From only the ten percent of genes with the highest variance in expression, 65 % were present within the pathways. A greater overlap was achieved in focused PRAD analysis where 6,591 RNA-seq genes (84 %) occurred within the gene sets (Figure 2C). Furthermore, the Jaccard indices as heatmap showed the similarity between the gene sets (Figure 2D). Particularly the ontology gene sets display the greatest likeness.

## Pan-cancer analysis
The distribution of age at the initial diagnosis is left-skewed around the mean of 59 years. Regarding the distribution of cancer types within the pan-cancer analysis, BRCA brings the most (1094) patients. The median number of samples per cancer type is 262 (mean = 295) and cancer types ACC, CHOL, DLBC, KICH, MESO, READ, UCS, and UVM have less than 100 samples (See appendix). For closer analysis PCA and UMAP were applied on the cleaned RNA-seq data frame. The two-dimensional UMAP components were plotted and colored according to the 33 cancer types (Figure 4A). Around two-thirds of the cancer types buildt individual clusters. But not every cluster was pure of one cancer type. Furthermore, the were one large and two smaller clusters consisting of multiple cancer types where no differentiation was possible. Trying to characterize the cancer types with pathway activity, GSVA was applied with the mentioned 555 pathways. Next, PCA and UMAP were again applied and plotted (Figure 4B) allowing a comparison of the UMAP plots. After GSVA only ten separate clusters were visible. Whereas some of the clusters before GSVA reappeared as individual clusters, many cancer types formed one enormous cluster. To find out more about the differences between the enormous cluster and the smaller ones the pathway activity for the nine pathways with the largest variance across all cancer types was dyed (Figure 4C). These pathways include cell cycle, DNA replication and repair, the E2F transcription factor family, proteasome, and the oncogenes myc and kras. In general, the enormous cluster and one small cluster showed predominantly increased pathway activity (BLCA, BRCA, CESC, COAD, DLBC, ESCA, HNSC, LAML, LUAD, LUSC, MESO, OV, PAAD, READ, SARC, SKCM, STAD, TGCT, THYM, UCEC, UCS, UVM). In contrast, the remaining clusters showed rather decreased pathway activity (ACC, CHOL, GBM, KICH, KIRC, KIRP, LGG, LIHC, PCPG, PRAD, THCA). When UMAP was performed for each separate cancer type, BRCA, ESCA, KIRC, LAML, LUAD, TGCT, THYM showed subclusters. After GSVA these clusters were no longer visible except for BLCA, TGCT.

The pan-cancer clusters were mostly verified by a correlation heatmap, where the mean pathway activity for every cancer type was computed (Figure 5). The two main clusters match the clusters from the UMAP with two exceptions: PAAD and UVM were clustered with the down regulated cancer types from the UMAP. A closer look at the correlation heatmap also shows very strong correlation between COAD and READ as well as between HNSC and LUSC.

Looking at the 30 pathways with the highest variance among all patients, three major cluster were identified (Figure 6). First, a rather metabolism-oriented group, second, a DNA and cell cycle-oriented group and third, an immune system-oriented group. For these 30 pathways there were no clusters for specific cancer types recognizable.

![Pathway activty (after GSVA) per sample for the 30 gene sets with the highest variance among all cancer types.](report_figures/figure70.jpg){width=70%}

Based on the pathway activity matrix, another goal was to build a linear regression model. Here, it was tried to predict the activity of the pathway "proteasome". The pathway model had a smaller R-squared value (0.625) than the PC model (0.842). In the pathway model the root mean square error (RMSE) of the validation model was like the RMSE of the training model, whereas in the PC model the RMSE of the validation model was almost twice as large as the training model.

## Focused analysis
To show differences in gene expression between tumor and normal PRAD samples, a volcano plot was created (Figure 8A). Each gene in this volcano plot is represented by one dot. 998 genes that were significantly downregulated in the tumor tissue are colored in blue. 347 genes, which were significantly upregulated red. For GOEA the GO terms of the 500 differentially expressed genes from with the highest significance, the genes above upper horizontal line in the volcano plot, were determined. 484 genes were matched with at least one GO term. Some GO terms with the highest frequency were for example “protein binding” (357 counts), “membrane” (221), “cytoplasm” (205), or “nucleus” (132) (Figure 8B). GSVA with the GO gene sets, PCA and UMAP were applied, showing two separated cluster (Figure 8C left). Annotating the sample type revealed that the two clusters are formed by the tumor and normal samples. Both clusters show four samples from the opposite tissue source, respectively. Looking at the “normal” samples, there is a horizontal "gap" visible withing the “normal” cluster. This "gap" is far greater when performing the GSVA with the gene sets from pan-cancer analysis (Figure 8C right). Here, there are two separated clusters of normal samples and one widely scattered tumor cluster containing again four normal samples.

After GSVA, another volcano plot was created. Here, each dot in the volcano plot represents one pathway (Figure 9A). There were five downregulated and eleven upregulated gene sets in the tumor tissue. The eleven upregulated gene sets differ in the gene set size and fold change (Figure 9B). The gene set "myc targets V2" had the highest fold change of 0.848. However, this gene set contains 236 genes and is the largest of the upregulated gene sets. In total, only 3.3 % of the genes in the gene set were differentially expressed. The gene set "E2F targets" had the second largest fold change of 0.751 and 11.0 % upregulated genes. The gene sets "G2M checkpoint" (13,7 %), "androgen response" (11.8 %) and "E2F targets" (11.0 %) contained the most differentially expressed genes. Dying the samples according to the pathway activity of six of the upregulated pathways, the differences between tumor and normal samples were visualized (Figure 9C). The two normal clusters were rather downregulated, but do not look identical. The tumor samples were mostly upregulated.

# Discussion
In pan-cancer analysis two major clusters of cancers were identified. A pathway activity matrix supported the idea of upregulated cancer hallmarks. The focused analysis of PRAD revealed the differences between tumor and normal samples.

## Preprocessing and analysis of gene sets
The analysis with the Venn diagrams showed that not every RNA-seq gene is represented at least once in any gene set. This has the consequence that information will be lost whenever a method only uses the genes included within the gene sets. This effect is stronger in the pan-cancer analysis than in the focused analysis. Not only shows this a downside of reducing the data into pathways but also stresses how much information about transcriptomics are yet to be discovered. The dissimilarity between the gene sets which was illustrated with the Jaccard heatmap was the try to increase the overlap with the RNA-seq genes. A careful analysis with the chosen gene sets was possible and performed.

Not only does this show a downside of reducing the data into pathways, but also stresses how much information about transcriptomics is yet to be discovered. The dissimilarity between the gene sets, which was illustrated with the Jaccard heatmap, was the try to increase the overlap with the RNA-seq genes. It shows that most ontology gene sets are more similar than others as they were clustered together. The reason might be that these gene sets are quite large since gene ontology terms like “chromosome” or “cell cycle” are very broad and include cellular structures.

## Pan-cancer analysis
The comparison of the UMAP plots before and after GSVA showed that information seemed to be lost within the pathway activity matrix. On the one hand some cancer types of clusters were preserved, but on the other hand many clusters were lost or condensed into one enormous cluster. Dying the clusters according to highly variant pathway activity indicates the possibility to split the cancer types into two main groups. This is a very unsatisfying result, hinting that either the pathways used in the study did not cover enough of the RNA-seq information or some cancer types are too alike to be separated based on the used pathways. Eventually, the hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) are characteristics shared among most cancers. The next step would be to refine this analysis. The same trend was also visible when checking the cancer types by themself. Based on the clinical annotations, the cancer ESCA could be separated by the subtypes Esophagus Adenocarcinoma and Esophagus Squamous Cell Carcinoma and TGCT by Seminoma and Non-seminoma. But only TGCT and BLCA showing clusters after GSVA again emphasizes the loss of information.
The cancer type correlation heatmap supported mostly the findings from UMAP after GSVA. The two strongly correlating pairs were rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). READ and COAD not-only share a close localization, but also share histological, genetic and methylation patterns (Tamas et al., 2015). HNSC and LUSC have multiple molecular characteristics in common, although they are genetically and heterogeneous diverse (Polo et al., 2016).
The heatmap for 30 pathways with the highest variance in their activity allowed clustering into three main groups: metabolism, DNA/cell cycle and immune response. These three are part of the hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). For a more precise analysis it would be necessary to group the used gene sets to the 10 hallmarks. Nevertheless, it would be different to makes these assignments since they also overlap with each other. Interestingly, in this heatmap there are no clear clusters for the 33 cancer types. This suggests that these pathways activity varies even among same cancers so much that they could not be clustered together. 
Eventually, a multivariate linear regression model was built. Although the pathway model explained less of the total variance of the model than the PC model, it was the more promising model. The much higher RMSE of the PC validation set, suggests a strong overfitting when using the 300 PCs as predictors. To improve the pathway model, better suiting pathways must be found. As a next step, it might also be interesting whether it is possible to predict a cancer type based on RNA-seq data respective pathway activity.


## Focused analysis: Prostate adenocarcinoma
The volcano plots illustrates the differences in expression between tumor and normal cells. Knowledge about GO terms of the differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor samples of PRAD allowed an insight into the cellular functions. Computing the GO term frequency showed that, changes caused by cancer cannot be pinned down to a restricted part of a cell, but rather causes changes within the whole cell. The GOEA resulted in two almost pure sample clusters. The four respective exceptions could not be explained with known clinical annotations. It is also to be considered that only the 484 most significantly differentially expressed genes were part of the GO gene sets. One thing that caught the eye was that the normal samples were showing a horizontal gap within the UMAP cluster. The gap between the two clusters with normal samples is by far greater after the GSVA with the gene sets. Again, no clinical annotations explained this effect. The GSVA used many more pathways and genes than the GOEA. The four normal samples within the tumor samples are also visible, here. In general, even though the Venn diagram showed a better overlap with the RNA-seq data in the focused analysis than in the pan-cancer analysis, the clustering results are more scattered. One explanation might be that the GSVA uses one combined data frame as input. On major difference was that the pan-cancer analysis only had cancer samples, the focused analysis used normal samples. Another interesting fact is that in the pan-cancer analysis PRAD was part of the scattered clusters with downregulated pathway activity. But some of the pathways reappeared in the focused analysis as upregulated compared to normal cells. Hence, the pathways seem to be upregulated to a certain level in PRAD, but not as much as compared to cancers of the enormous pan-cancer cluster. Perhaps the pathway activity is still too similar between tumor and normal cells in PRAD.
The volcano plot for the pathways also shows that only a small number of pathways is differentially expressed between the sample types. The GSVA considered by which degree the genes are up or downregulated. However, it does not correct against the pathway size which also effects the results. 
The volcano plots show only five gene sets were downregulated and eleven gene sets that were upregulated. Because gene sets with a relatively low log2 Fold Change of +/- 0.4 were defined to be differentially expressed this explains the low differential expression of the gene sets in PRAD. To our knowledge no source confirms that gene downregulation is more common than gene upregulation in Prostate Adenocarcinoma. However epigenetic alterations like DNA methylations, which are common in PRAD, could explain this observation (Ruggero et al., 2018). By taking the pathway size into account, one gene set containing plenty of differentially expressed genes that specifically stands out is the “androgen response”. Healthy prostate epithelium cells that potentially could give rise to PRAD have a unique metabolic background themselves, for they contain large amounts of zinc that prevent the oxidation of citrate, which thus can inhibit the citric acid cycle (TCA). Thus, making normal prostate epithelial cells dependent on different energy sources such as glycolysis. The control of the previous steps mentioned has been described to be controlled by the androgen receptor (AR) response. Once bound to an androgen hormone, such as testosterone, the AR acts as a transcription factor by traveling to the nucleus and thus activating the expression of metabolism-promoting genes in prostatic epithelial cells.  
Mutations in the androgen response pathway could potentially wreak havoc in favor of cancer progression. These mutations could lead to the promotion of the TCA and therefore could lead to dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic shift has been noticed in early prostate adenocarcinomas. Since this project revolved around RNA-seq data it can’t definitively be stated that the cause for the upregulation of the “androgen response” is the result of mutations, but it is apparent that crucial similarities between literature (Ahmad et al., 2021) and the RNA-seq analysis could be found.
On top of that, the plausible differential expression within the genes of the “G2M checkpoint” and the “E2F targets” can also be substantiated by literature. The G2M checkpoint itself is important for halting the cell cycle once DNA replication has been faulty whereas E2F itself is a DNA promotor binding protein that promotes the transcription of protein-coding genes. Therefore, irregularities in this checkpoint could potentially lead to tumor growth progression (Alberts, 2015).   
Generally, the upregulation of the tumor samples in the six UMAP graphs is concordant with the prior discussed revelations regarding the androgen response or even the G2M checkpoint-associated genes being upregulated. On the contrary, it is not completely clear why the normal samples in all these graphs can be separated into two clusters. It must be questioned though whether the gap between the two clusters increased because of their dissimilarities or because these samples simply didn’t belong to the same cluster regardless of the severity of dissimilarities.
